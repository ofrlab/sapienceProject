Project consists of two functional tools:
  1. autoCase
  2. autoImage

##### autoCase #####

Tool sets up all of the necessary ZFS data sets to work a case.

Tool does the following:
  1.    Ask for case name
  2.    Check if a case by that name already exists in the "Forensic_Cases" dataset
  3.    Create a dataset below "Forensic_Cases."
  3b.   Change owner to lab.
  4.    Create an "Images" dataset below the case dataset
  4b.   Change owner to lab.
  5.    Set compression=on on the "Images" dataset.
  6.    Set atime=off on the "Images" dataset.
  7.    Create a "Nuix" dataset below "Forensic_Cases."
  7b.   Change owner to lab.
  8.    Create an "Exports" dataset below "Forensic_Cases."
  8b.   Change owner to lab.
  9.    Set compression=on on the "Exports" dataset.
  10.   Create a "Reports" dataset below "Forensic_Cases."
  10b.  Change owner to lab.
  11.   Set compression=on on the "Reports" dataset.

##### autoImage #####

Tool safely images devices and takes zfs actions to secure image.

Tool does the following:
  1.    Ask for case name
  2.    Check that case already exists.
  3.    Ask for image name
  4.    Check if images already exists.
  5.    Ask for device to image.
  6.    Check that device is not in use (by OS of ZFS pool).
  7.    Create image named dataset below "Images" below case dataset.
  7b.   Change owner to lab.
  8.    Create dd directory
  9.    Image using dc3dd (segmented).
      a.  Image will be saved in the dd directory inside the image named dataset.
      b.  Image log file will be saved in image named datatset.
  10.   Sanpshot imaged named dataset (using date and time as name of snapshot).
  11.   Set readonly=on on image named dataset.
